<h1>Background </h1>
The most common use of Angular Frontends is using CRUD APIs to save and view data. 
We want you to create a Angular application to view a list of records, add records and edit records.

Assignment
We want you to create a Angular application that has the following areas.
You may use any CSS like bootstrap to make the pages look nice.

Form to create a new Person
The form should have fields for name, email, dob, avatar and country

List of Persons
On this page show the Name, Email, Avatar and Age (not date of birth) of the person. To show the age, you should create a pipe.
Clicking on the name of any person should open the form to edit the details
Show the list in a "card" format rather than a simple list. (CardView should be a custom component with input parameters).
Note : You DO NOT need to create any API. The API is already created. The details are available here - https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3129705/RWTpsGbZ

Assessment Criteria
Code quality of the Angular Code.
Code quality of the HTML and CSS if any.
Look and feel of the form and list pages.
